DEV NOTES


ARCHITECTURE


In the interest of time, KISS (Keep It Simple, Sister/Smartypants/Serenader).
So, I've decided to usd a boilerplate vuejs-node-express for a full backend and frontend mvc stack

The backend is going to be RESTful

So that the frontend can be implemented with intechangeably vuejs/react/any other js framework.
